                <h3>About Spielbound</h3>
                <p>
                    Spielbound is a company with two parts. One part is a for-profit coffee shop where customers can access and play games from the largest 
                    playable board game library in North America. Inside you will find that for just $5 you'll have access to thousands of board games that 
                    can be played all day long as well as the comforting environment of a local coffee shop. The coffee ranges from basic drip coffee to 
                    wild board game themed concoctions. This place commonly hosts several of their own events to teach new players how to play games and 
                    allows people in the community to connect with one another. People commonly have birthday parties, wedding receptions, and family 
                    gatherings here but it is also a good place to relax with friends.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    The other part of Spielbound a non-profit organization dedicated to creating a community around board games that focus on increasing 
                    the wellbeing of those around them. Spielbound's non-profit side has four sections that focus on benefiting the community. Spielbound 
                    works with educators to teach children through games and to increase their problem-solving skills. They also spend time with senior 
                    citizens to help them fight Alzheimer's and Dementia through playing board games that help stimulate the mind. The non-profit side 
                    also helps the people in their community develop new games and provide board games to organizations like the YMCA. Both sides of 
                    Spielbound want to create a community around board games and they provide an environment to do just that.
