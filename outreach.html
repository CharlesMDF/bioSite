                <h3>Spielbound's Outreach</h3>
                <p>
                    Spielbound's outreach consist of four separate arms which are education, Stay Sharp, Spielmasons, and Everyone Plays.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The education portion of Spielbound's outreach program is dedicated to using games to help improve kids learning environments 
                    by encouraging creativity and problem-solving skills. They are paired with UNO's College of Education to help train future 
                    educators in in incorporating games into classrooms. Their main goals are to inspire teachers to gamify classrooms and to show 
                    students that games can teach critical thinking and social skills.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Stay Sharp arm of Spielbound's outreach is dedicated to helping senior citizens maintain their mental fortitude. Spielbound 
                    says that playing certain types of games can help reduce the risk of dementia and provide protection against the development 
                    of Alzheimer's. Spielbound works with Senior communities around Omaha to provide opportunities to play games. They also have 
                    adopted many games to be friendlier to those with disabilities.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Spielmasons is a group hosted by Spielbound that is dedicated to highlighting those in the Omaha community who develop and 
                    test board games. The group is open to all that are willing to test unpublished board games and help in their development. 
                    The group also offers to help those who want to develop games by being a resource in game design.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The last part of Spielbounds outreach programs is Everybody Plays which is dedicated to making easily accessible to all. 
                    They regularly host free game demos that teach the community how to play different board games.
